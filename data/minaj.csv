Ay yo

Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court full drenched
Here go some haterade, get your thirst quenched 
Style'd on 'em in this Burberry trench 
This birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench 
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he bite a rock

Ay yo I been on, bitch you been con

Oh I get it
They paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats bitch, fuck the gossip 
How many of them could've did it with finesse? 
Now everybody like, ""she really is the best""
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch it's King Kong, yes it's King Kong
Bitch it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on 
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch it's King Kong, yes I'm King Kong
Dis is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom, with my Timbs on
(How many championships?) What? Six rings on

They need rappers like me

178,"What is white make up? And she’s not pretending to be anything, you guys love to talk about cultural appropriation but don’t know the definition so let me inform you, 1. NICKI has Japanese heritage so she isn’t appropriating anything 2. Chun Li is a game character, how can you appropriate a fictional character? 3. Appropriation is when you try to pass something off as your own, like you started, something Nicki didn’t do"

300,"You have to be unstable if you believe that a veteran in the industry would do a collaboration with a child that doesn't have consistent verses, a nice flow. And who's basically just about every rapper out there nowadays that makes music solely for the money. Not to mention that the child has disrespected Nicki Minaj on a numerous amount of occasions, as well as her mother to acquire social media fame as a meme. What would Nicki look like, featuring not a Rap Artist, but a Social Media star thats equivalent to somebody like WoahhVicky or Malu Trevejo, on one of her songs? Nicki putting Danielle on one of her songs, would be like Nicki putting somebody like Lil pump on one of her songs. Goodbye..."

355,"Just read the lyrics and you will realize that Nicki is a modern day female Shakespeare...

Ay yo
Look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court full drenched
Here go some haterade, get your thirst quenched 
Style'd on 'em in this Burberry trench 
This birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench 
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he bite a rock
Ay yo I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men Benz foreign
He keep on dialing Nicki, like the Prince song
I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ay yo I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say 'Chung-Li' drop the Benz off
Oh I get it
They paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me
I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats bitch, fuck the gossip 
How many of them could've did it with finesse? 
Now everybody like, ""she really is the best""
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch it's King Kong, yes it's King Kong
Bitch it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on 
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch it's King Kong, yes I'm King Kong
Dis is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom, with my Timbs on
(How many championships?) What? Six rings on
They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fuckin' keyboards and make me, the bad guy
Chun-Li
Ay yo I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men Benz foreign 
He keep on dialing Nicki, like the Prince song
I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ay yo I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say 'Chung-Li' drop the Benz off
I am alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs
It's my lifestyle
I am alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs 
It's my lifestyle
I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin' sci-fi
Give me the password, to the fuckin' WiFi"
