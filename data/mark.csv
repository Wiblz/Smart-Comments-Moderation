Also I appreciate your dedication as well as everything you do, but I feel I speak for alot of your viewers when I say, this is totally unnecessary...you said yourself a large number of people asked you not to, I'm just a nobody that doesn't know anything, but you should listen to your fans maybe? Unless you enjoy the flaming sensation in which case that is none of my business 😊"

136,STOP
137,"Mark, please stop this!! You are ruining your body by doing it. We don't care if you miss a few days! This ghost pepper promise could destroy your overall health... Not to mention the possiblity of death if you keep eating them so much. We would rather miss you few uploads than see you suffer! So please, Mark, don't make promises like that anymore. At least give a forfeit that can't seriously damage your body. Take as much time as you need to sign calenders!"
138,“You like jazz?”
139,Mark suffering with relaxing jazz in the background.
140,This is why I subscribed. Because he is awesome

155,the music really sets the mood lmao
156,Ghost pepper ain’t shit. Try a Carolina Reaper.
157,I like that u keep ur promise but I hate seeing you suffer
158,Doesn’t this video count as a video? And if it does... that means you no have to eat pepper.... but then that would mean the pepper video is a lie....

163,Lmao sounds like the music to Getting Over It. Just need the narrator passive aggressively talking shit in the background now.
164,"THE POOR CARTON, WHY DRINK STRAIGHT FROM IT. AAHHHHHH MAKES ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I WILL STILL WAATTTCCCCHHH"
165,“Do it” said the emperor.

169,Lmao...my with Alexa every day
170,The jazz reminds me of jack
171,Not satisfied until you eat a Carolina reaper...
172,The sad thing is that this is something I would do
173,"feel the jazz, man feel the jazz!"
174,"man, u r into spice challenge all the way but still say be careful cuz having too much of good thing could burn the lining of your stomach . I also has some habenero sauce with  my burrito today for dinner which was pretty awesome."
175,MARK WHEN YOU WERE TALING TO ALEXA MINE TURNED ON AND AWNSERED YOU
176,Oooofffffff to your tast buds and say goodbye cus your going to miss them
177,Please dont
178,Ya like Jazz?
179,"If your so great at keeping promises then where is that Corpse Party playthrough you promised us over 2 years ago? :P And I mean the good remake not the classic you already did, because you said you'd play the other one in big bold letters on the fist video. Please Mark? I miss horror RPG's..."
180,Music made it way better😂
181,I could not even eat that chilly pepper
182,"To the idiots who say those peppers are really bad and could kill you, no. No, they really arent. Someone else said how theyre not bad, this is another reason. Many spicy foods are made of hot peppers (or any other spicy pepper). Spicy peppers contain a neurotoxin called Capsaicin which in large doses could cause Seizures, Heart Attacks, and yes, even Death. BUUUUUT... You'd have to eat about 3 pounds of the worlds hottest pepper (which doesnt sound like much, but it's actually over 100 or 200 peppers, cant remember) in one sitting for it to be fatal. So no, Mark will not die. Now please, shut the fuck up, go to school, and get some god damn knowledge."
183,E
184,The jazz helps XD
185,Fuckadodle fuck
186,Hella on shrooms watching this wtf lmao hella trippy
187,"FYI, the spiciness won't cause ulcers. It stimulates temperature receptors, so that feeling of death in your mouth is actually just the feeling of your mouth and stomach burning from the inside out (without actually physical burning)... =D"
188,You should stop. You're worrying me.
189,Rip markipliers throat stomach and Tung 2018-2018
190,Suffer for entertainment.
191,My Alexa went off when Mark said “Alexa...”
192,The worst part is how long the aftertaste is and how spicy it is it's torture
193,But this is a paradox because he’s making a video about his punishment for not making a video but by making this video he’s made the punishment pointless because he’s kept his promise
194,Mark you dont have to do this! Its not fun seeing you eating that!
195,are you ok?!? you look like your in a lot of pain... feel better
196,Do Carolina pepper now
197,stop!! your hurting yourself!!
198,"No epic songs XD OMG I say the perfect song just been right on que lmao, you're so cool of Man of your word Mark stay strong, spicy levels are temporary you can do it <3"
199,"*YES MARKIMOO, IT IS YOUR WORLD!* AND PROMISES DO MATTER, but it doesn't mean you have to keep this promise, hurting hurting yourself for OUR entertainment.. Yea its funny for the kicks of it, but we care about you too"
200,But why though

248,"Mark, sToP"

250,OH HE NEEDS SOME MILK
251,"OK now look, I know he said he's doing this because he's a man of his word and all that, and I appreciate and respect that, but what I can't stand is that you're doing this to yourself. I've been watching you for a couple years now and don't get me wrong everything you do is funny, but when you get hurt or put yourself through these painful things on purpose I just can't stand it. Now I'm not telling you to stop because it's your choice not mine and your committed to it, but please promise me this, be careful, take it easy, you don't have to push yourself to do this for us.
I hope you understand what I'm saying and I just wanna let you know that I'll never stop watching you, you've brought me joy when I'm down, you make me cry when you cry, and I wanna thank you, so much, more than you could think.
-A caring fan☺️😊
P.S- for anyone who sees this I just wanna put this out, my Instagram is @unicorn_buddie_10
P.S(again)- Thank you again Mark so much, if you were to ever stop YouTube I'd be with you, but until that could ever happen, I'll be with you on your side the whole way😊😊"

376,"DO ANOTHER ""TRY NOT TO LAUGH"" 😁😊👌❤"
377,"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."

415,"For decades, doctors thought eating a lot of spicy food caused stomach ulcers, or painful sores on the lining of the esophagus, stomach or upper area of the small intestine. ... Studies showed that spicy food doesn't cause ulcers, though it can irritate existing ulcers, which explains the misunderstanding."
