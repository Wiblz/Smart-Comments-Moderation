..if the two of you are enjoying life together..*DON'T GET MARRIED*  If the two of you would like to see the relationship end within 5 years *get married*...and if you do get her to sign a *prenup* !!!!!!
When two ppl love each other there's nothing worse than having a piece binding the two of you together, stay independently without conditions in love."
212,ma perchè il tono della sua voce è così alta ?
213,They really meant for each other :) hope it lasts forever
214,Shes a gold digger
215,"I'm guessing a lot of people haven't heard Marzia talk before so I'll try and do a quick summary on why on earth she has that voice lol (from what i've seen/heard).

In a very old video with Felix she is speaking and has a much deeper, 'normal' sounding voice. When I first saw this i thought for sure that this voice she puts on now is fake. But apparently that's the voice she would put on when she was nervous because she was aware of how weird her accent sounded. She is Italian so that could have something to do with it at as well, and she had nasal surgery at some point.

Hope that clears it up lol"
216,Felix is a confirmed soy boy
217,This video is 3 days later
218,"I was expecting pewds to propose by the end of the quiz, wait, did he propose yet? If no, DO IT PEWDS"
219,He already did. Privately when they were in Japan. You should check Marzia's youtube channel and there's a video there where Pewds and her explained how the proposal happened.
220,CONGRATS PEWDS!!! I'M SOOO PROUD
221,I'm sorry Pewds but Matthias took the name Luna

247,Next vid plz : Are WE Ready to have sex.
248,"Thank you for asking ME, Pewdiepie. In MY opinion, YOU should absolutely get married. Yes, you will probably lose 1,5 % of your current scroggler amount. However, you can upload videos on marriage and family related topics. Can YOU imagine the growth of this channel, if there will be a baby in the future? CAN YOU?! I calculated that the birth of a child is at least 1.2 million new scrogglers worth. Oh, I am amazed, man, soooo amazed. This Channel could really skyrocket! Finally it will be a FAMILY-FRIENDLY channel. There is a lot of beautiful ad space! I see a lot of potential! So...- thank YOU for asking ME this very private question. Of course, I did not watch the video AT ALL, but you can thank ME later with a GREAT donation. Signed by #YourRandomInternetDouche"
249,Omg the suka blyat shirt😂😂
250,I’m so happy for you both! Congratulations Felix and Marzia ☺️ all marzipans and bros wish you guys a wonderful married life together 💖

264,11:59 Matthias and Amanda?
265,"people saying they're gonna divorce and she'll claim half of his assets, she's a gold-digger, she's cheating on him, etc... you obviously have not watched much of Felix and Marzia, especially their vlogs. They're so in love with each other that it just makes love so real and wonderful and possible.

Also, to the people asking ""why is her voice high-pitched?"" I haven't looked this up lately but I remember in a video she said something about nasal issues, which may be factor (smaller airway = higher pitch). It may be her accent or her Italian roots. Heck, it just might be because she has a high-pitched voice because it's *normal* for some girls to have high-pitched voices. Have you never heard one before? So leave it alone, why don't ya?

Congrats to the engaged, hope you have a wonderful time!"
266,jellojyles ikr Haters gonna hate! LIKE STOP HATING ON HER MARZIA AND FELIX LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH THEY WILL NEVER DIVORCE

280,"Just don’t be stupid and get a prenup. If not in ten hrs she will take half your money for essentially doing nothing. Blows my mind when people with a lot of money think they don’t need it. “But we love each other!” Don’t be an idiot. Being logical in no means doesn’t mean you don’t love someone or trust them. 
I’ll check back in a few years when you’re whining on a video about divorce. See if you were smart enough to not be stupid. 🤦‍♂️"

291,"Pewdie this is the thing I tell every couple that before they get married go to marriage counselling and after they tied the knot go to marriage counselling. This means find that old couple who's been married for 30+ years and neither one of them have experienced divorce and learn from them. Just cause you found your ""soul mate"" don't mean shit. Marriage takes work, love takes sacrifice and commitment. If your not ready for that then don't, but however if you are don't wait get married."
